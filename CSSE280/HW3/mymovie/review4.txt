Obviously this movie is not to be watched for its impressive morality. It's more likely that the story came from a "wouldn't it be cool if..." moment, but never the less it is entertaining and has a story line that keeps you interested. Sure, it doesn't involve any deep philosophical thinking, but actual religious teachings aren't any better. Sorry to all who were looking for a life-changing experience from this movie.
